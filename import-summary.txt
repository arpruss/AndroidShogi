ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* BONANZA-README.txt
* LICENSE.TXT
* README
* TODO
* backup\
* backup\BonanzaDownloader.java
* external_jars\
* external_jars\jsoup-1.6.1.jar
* external_jars\juniversalchardet-1.0.3.jar
* images\
* images\icon-hires.png
* images\screen1.png
* images\screen2.png
* init.pl

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* jni\ => app\src\main\jni\
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* test\res\ => app\src\androidTest\res\
* test\src\ => app\src\androidTest\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
